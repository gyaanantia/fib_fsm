@W: MT531 :"/home/gfa2226/fpga/fibonacci/sv/fibonacci.sv":40:4:40:7|Found signal identified as System clock which controls 67 sequential elements including done_c.  Using this clock, which has no specified timing constraint, can prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and can adversely impact design performance.

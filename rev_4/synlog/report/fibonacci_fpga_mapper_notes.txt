@N: MF578 :"/home/gfa2226/fpga/fibonacci/sv/fibonacci.sv":40:4:40:7|Incompatible asynchronous control logic preventing generated clock conversion of minus_1_c[15] (in view: work.fibonacci(verilog)). Check "Force Generated Clock Conversion with Asynchronous Signals" in "GCC & Prototyping Tools" tab or set force_async_genclk_conv option to 1 in project file to enable. This should only be set if asynchronous control logic cannot cause a clock edge.
